                        In the context of solving this problem, we see 3 major limits to human
                        negotiators: computational, cognitive bias and emotional.

                  How many times have we made errors of judgment because we were angry,
                  jealous or euphoric. These are great feelings, but do we want them

                <h3 class="cbp-nttrigger"> Cognitively Biased?</h3>
                <div class="cbp-ntcontent"> In his seminal book 
                  <u>Thinking Fast and Slow</u>, Daniel Kahneman, eloquently
                  describes numerous scenarios where we use heuristics, shortcuts, 
                  to make decisions and answer difficult questions. One of the most
                  well known, anchoring, is our predisposition to rely on the first
                  piece of information when answering a question. So if we tell you
                  that there are 1500 pages in War and Peace and ask you to make an
                  offer on our product, you become anchored to 1500 and will suggest
                  a number closer to it than otherwise. Imagine how many decisions a
                  human negotiator has to make while keeping track of random, and 
                  frequently irrelevant, numbers in his head.

                <h3 class="cbp-nttrigger"> Computationally Challanged?</h3>
                <div class="cbp-ntcontent"> Numerous advances in artificial
                  intelligence and computational power have made computers better 
                  than man at numerous tasks. Thanks to IBM computers can now beat 
                  humans at complicated games such as chess and Jeopardy. Nowadays 
                  we trust them to execute complicated tasks because they are faster
                  and are able to consider more pieces of information. Consider that 
                  programs exist for speech and image recognition or machine learning 
                  algorithms that alert customers to unauthorized credit card 
                  transactions. In scenarios where a lot of data is available, and 
                  many computations need to be made, computers, are better.
                  <br> At the end of the day, our human desires drive our economic
                  endeavors. Florissant Advisors, too, is a human company that also
                  suffers from the flaws, we just want to do <em>better</em>.

                <div class="cbp-ntcontent">
                  Calculating the dollar value of a deal or an exchange. If we 
                  agree on a deal where we sell you a car for $10000 above what
                  it cost us, that deal is worth $10000 to us. But what if we're 
                  trying to structure a multiyear deal, with numerous delivery dates
                  of various products and quantities? Each of these becomes a 
                  parameter in the valuation problem. We can assign a value to each 
                  parameter; an agreed upon term in our negotiation. For example, 
                  delivery at the end of the month of 1000 red widget. The problem is
                  figuring out which of the possibly many assignments is best for 
                  both parties in an exchange. The possible number of assignments is 
                  the multiplication across all of your parameters and depends on how
                  many values each of those parameters can take.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Consider a scenario where we are negotiation over four parameters such
                  as price, quantity, delivery dates, and quality. Each of these 
                  parameters has a different number of possible assignment. In the 
                  scenario, if we are considering all prices between $1000 and $2000 
                  in $50 increments (20 possible values), any quantity between 6000 
                  and 14000 in 100 unit increments (80 possible values), delivery date 
                  on any date in September (30 days) and 5 possible quality ratings that 
                  give us a total of (20 * 80 * 30 * 5) 240000 possible assignments.

                <h3 class="cbp-nttrigger"> How do traditional negotiation strategies                        reduce the valuation problem? </h3>
                <div class="cbp-ntcontent"> When a human negotiator calculates 
                  his BATNA or reserve value, she is explicitly setting a bound on 
                  a parameter within a negotiation. Chances are pretty good that the 
                  desired negotiated settlement still lies in this bounded solution
                  space, but there is still a small chance, that given the right 
                  circumstances, you might want to trade outside of this bounded area.

                <br>
                    Another example is the order with which we resolve issues.
                  For example, in a car buying scenario we might consider features,
                  then price and then financing. That order might means that once
                  we've agreed on a feature it is no longer an issue to be resolved.
                  On the other hand, the resulting agreement could be different if
                  we considered the parameters in a different order, such as
                  financing, price and then features. Which of the two possible
                  outcomes is the better outcome for both parties?

                  the interview that it takes to extract what is relevant to each
                  party. Once that process is complete, the actual computation time is negligible.
